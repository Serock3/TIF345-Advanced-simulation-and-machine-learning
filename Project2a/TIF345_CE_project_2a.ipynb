    "## Alloys\n",
    "\n",
    "Alloys are multicomponent systems, in which several species are mixed with each other on at least one sublattice.\n",
    "Examples include metallic alloys such as steel or bronze as well as semiconductor alloys such as gallium indium nitride (blue lasers).\n",
    "In order to study the energetics of such systems on the atomistic scale one often resorts to density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which can provide the energy of a given atomistic structure with high accuracy.\n",
    "The mixing energy per atom of a structure is defined as\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\large\n",
    "    E_\\text{mix} = \\frac{E_\\text{structure} - n_\\text{Ag} E_\\text{Ag} - n_\\text{Pd} E_\\text{Pd}}{n_\\text{Ag} + n_\\text{Pd}}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "where $E_\\text{structure}$ is the total energy of the structure, $n_\\text{Ag}$ number of Ag atoms in the structure and $E_\\text{Ag}$ the energy of pure Ag.\n",
    "Working with the mixing energy is often convient as it is the relevant energy when considering e.g. phase stability of alloys.\n",
    "Below a few different structures (configurations) are displayed.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The configurational space problem\n",
    "If we consider a binary system (A-B) and a lattice consisting of 100 atoms, this yields $2^{100}\\approx 10^{30}$ ways of occupying the lattice.\n",
    "While many of the structures will be duplicates when considering translation and rotational invariance we are still left with a huge number of configurations that would need to be considered, e.g., when calculating thermodynamic averages or conducting ground state searches.\n",
    "Calculating the energy of multiple structures with DFT is computationally very expensive and thus to solve this configurational space problem one often turns to building atomistic models based on DFT.\n",
    "So-called alloy cluster expansions are the most commonly employed technique in this context.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Cluster expansions\n",
    "The alloy cluster expansion model is based on an ideal lattice.\n",
    "This lattice can be occupied by various atomic species (Ag and Pd in our case).\n",
    "In this approach the energy of the atomic structure is modeled as a sum over the average number of times a particular cluster occurs multiplied with corresponding effective cluster interactions (ECIs).\n",
    "Formally\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    \\large\n",
    "    E_\\text{mix} = J_0 + \\sum _\\alpha N_\\alpha J_\\alpha,\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "where $\\alpha$ refers to various clusters such as nearest neighbor pairs, next nearest neighbor pairs, triplets etc, $N_\\alpha$ refers to the number of such clusters for the present structure per atom and $J_\\alpha$ is the corresponding effective cluster interaction (ECI) for cluster $\\alpha$.\n",
    "In this project, it is of no concern how the extraction of identical and unique clusters using crystal symmetries is done.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/clusters_v1.png\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 650px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead we will focus on how to determine the unknown parameters (ECIs) $J_\\alpha$, and how to choose which type of clusters to include in the model, i.e. the size and structure of the parameter space.\n",
    "If the clusters $\\alpha$ are enumerated, the equation above can be formulated as a dot product by defining $\\boldsymbol{x}=[1, N_1, N_2, \\ldots]$ and $\\boldsymbol{J}=[J_0, J_1, J_2, \\ldots]$ as $E_\\text{mix} = \\boldsymbol{x} \\boldsymbol{J}$.\n",
    "Here, $\\boldsymbol{x}$ is often refered to as the cluster vector of the given configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the mixing energy $E_\\text{mix}$ is calculated using DFT for a set of configurations, then the problem of finding the ECIs $\\boldsymbol{J}$ can be solved, e.g., using ordinary least-squares (OLS)\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    \\large\n",
    "    \\boldsymbol{J}_\\text{opt} = \\min_\\boldsymbol{J} || \\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{J} - \\boldsymbol{E}_\\text{mix} ||_2 ^2,\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "where $\\boldsymbol{E}_\\text{mix}$ is a vector containing the mixing energies for all structures and $\\boldsymbol{X}$ a matrix, each row of which corresponds to a cluster vector of one of the structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The linear problem\n",
    "While OLS is the simplest method for finding ECIs, it has a tendency for overfitting.\n",
    "Linear regression with regularization such as ridge or LASSO are therefore favorable alternatives.\n",
    "A common issue in finding the ECIs is to select an approriate number of features (clusters) to include in the model.\n",
    "Features in our problem correspond to clusters with different interatomic distances and of different order (pairs, triplets etc; see above).\n",
    "Including too few (many) can lead to underfitting (overfitting).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project you will construct cluster expansion models using linear regression methods such as Lasso and ARDR.\n",
    "You will use cross-validation (CV) but also information criteria such as AIC and BIC in order to evaluate how many features are reasonable to include in your model.\n",
    "For more information and details about these methods and metrics, consult the section \"Additional Information\" below.\n",
    "Lastly, you will see how Bayesian parameter estimation of the ECIs can be used to analyze results obtained via a cluster expansion.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cross-validation\n",
    "You may freely choose a suitable cross-valdation method to use for the following tasks.\n",
    "K-fold is commonly used and available through `sklearn` (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.KFold.html).\n",
    "Ten folds might be a good starting point to try out.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Information criteria\n",
    "The Bayesian information criteria (BIC) is defined as\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\text{BIC} = 2 \\log(L_*) - N_p \\log(N_d)\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "where $L_*$ is the maximized likelihood, $N_p$ the number of parameters, and $N_d$ number of data points.     \n",
    "The energies (or data) can be modeled through\n",
    "Here we assume the errors, $\\epsilon$, are normal distributed with zero mean and variance $\\sigma^2$.\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\boldsymbol{E} = \\boldsymbol{x} \\boldsymbol{J} + \\epsilon , \\quad \\epsilon \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu=0, \\sigma^2) \\\\\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "Therefore the likelihood, $P(D|\\boldsymbol{J}, \\sigma)$, can be defined as\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "L = P(D|\\boldsymbol{J}, \\sigma) = \\frac{1}{(2\\pi \\sigma^2)^{N_d/2}}\\exp{(-||\\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{J}-\\boldsymbol{E} ||^2 / 2\\sigma^2)}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "The ECIs, $\\boldsymbol{J}$, you will obtain from linear regression algorithms (LASSO, etc), and $\\sigma$ can be found from setting $\\frac{\\mathrm{d} L }{\\mathrm{d} \\sigma} = 0$. This is left as an exercise to the reader but the final expression for BIC becomes\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\text{BIC} = -N_d \\log(\\text{MSE}) - N_p \\log(N_d) + \\text{const}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "where the constant term, $\\text{const}$, is irrelevant and $\\text{MSE}$ is the mean squared error, defined as \n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\text{MSE} = \\frac{1}{N_d}||\\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{J}-\\boldsymbol{E} ||^2\n",

    "Regression algorithms such as Lasso, ridge, automatic relevance detection (ARD) and many more are available via [`sklearn`](https://scikit-learn.org/).\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note: Since we are including the constant term in our cluster vectors (corresponding to $J_0$ and implying that the first element is always 1), we need to set `fit_intercept=False` when using the linear models from sklearn.*"
